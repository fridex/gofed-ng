This section discusses about gofed-ng installation and configuration.
Make sure that you are familiar with basic idea, terminology and goals behind
gofed-ng listed in section <a href="#architecture">Architecture</a> before
proceeding.

<h3>How To Run gofed-ng</h3>

<h4>Packaged gofed-ng</h4>

If you want to run gofed-ng, you have to install it first. The easiest way how
to do it is to let your package manager do the dirty work for you. You can
install gofed-ng by running (on Fedora 23):

<pre><code class="bash">
$ sudo dnf install -y gofed
</code></pre>

After successful installation, you should have ready to run gofed application in
your <code>$PATH</code>. Let's try it out:

<pre><code class="bash">
$ gofed --help
</code></pre>

Now you are ready to use gofed-ng system. If you have special needs, you can
configure your gofed-ng as desired.

<h4>Git Repo gofed-ng</h4>

If you want latest-greatest version of gofed-ng or you do not have gofed in
repositories, you can clone gofed-ng git repository:

<code><pre class="bash">
$ git clone https://github.com/gofed/gofed-ng
</code></pre>

After cd'ing to your cloned git repo run <code>make</code> to download necessary
modules, generate needed files and install dependencies.

<code><pre class="bash">
$ make
</code></pre>

Now you are ready to run services located at <code>services/</code> directory, the
registry and the client.

<code><pre class="bash">
$ ./registry
</code></pre>

<code><pre class="bash">
$ ./gofed --help
</code></pre>

<h3>system.json</h3>

<p>
After bootstrapping your gofed, you should have <code>system.json</code> file
located on top of your git tree. This file is auto-generated based on your
gofed-ng services. This file holds mapping, documentation and actions of
services. You can look at the latest system.json file at <a
href="/system.json">system.json</a>, which is periodically updated. This json
file is also used to generate API listing in section <a href="#api">System
API</a>.


<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>
Configuration for each service is auto-generated while bootstrapping as well as
for gofed-ng client.  You can review the current gofed-ng configuration file to
see all available configuration options.
