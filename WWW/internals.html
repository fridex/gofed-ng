<h2>Internals of gofed-ng</h2>

<p>
This page is a brief overview of gofed communication layer internals.
If you want more details, dive into the <a href="#source">source code</a>. The
gofed-ng application uses modules, which are developed separately to make code
clean, allow maximum module re-usage and be able to track issues on as small
parts as possible. The philosophy behind the project is same as for Unix: "Small
is beautiful!" and "Make each program do one thing well.".

<h3>Client</h3>

<p>
There is nothing special on the client side. It uses <code>System</code> class to
encapsulate all the communication.

<h3>Registry</h3>

<p>
There was used <a href="http://rpyc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">RPyC</a>
registry.

<h3>Services</h3>

<p>
<code>CompuatationalServices</code> and <code>StorageServices</code> are
encapsulated with <code>ServiceEnvelope</code>, which does all routine work for
services such as configuration file parsing, command line arguments handling,
service instantiating etc. Moreover, it notifies services about start up and
termination to correctly handle service signals <code>signal_startup()</code> and
<code>signal_terminate()</code>.

<p>
After all routine work was done, <code>ServiceEnvelope</code> forks and execs
a worker. A child process is done because of correct signals handling for worker
and clean up.

<p>
The worker is represented by <code>CompuatationalServices</code> or
<code>StorageServices</code> class based on the service type. Every time
a connection is made, worker instantiates <code>CompuatationalServices</code> or
<code>StorageServices</code> object to serve requests. Every object instance
represents one connection with a remote. After the connection is closed, object
is destructed. Every instance runs in a separate thread.

<p>
If a service is run locally, it uses <code>ServiceWrapper</code> class to simulate
remote connection for a service.

<h3>System</h3>

<p>
The key idea of gofed-ng is in <code>System</code> class. <code>System</code>
encapsulates all the communication, serialization, object instantiation, action
calls etc.  It uses <code>Communication</code> class in order to represent
a communication with remotes or instances of local services.
