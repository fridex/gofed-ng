<h2>Architecture of the gofed-ng system</h2>

The gofed-ng system is a distributed system used for analysing, data storing and
data retrieving.  There are three main components in the gofed-ng system:

<ul>
  <li>a client</li>
  <li>a registry</li>
  <li>services</li>
</ul>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>service</dt>
  <dd>
    A service which is offered to a client. Services expose <i>actions</i>. See
    <i>Services</i> subsection bellow for more info.
  </dd>

  <dt>system</dt>
  <dd>
    Also referred as a "gofed-ng system", is a set of services available in the
    system.
  </dd>

  <dt>action</dt>
  <dd>
    Uniquely identified exposed function by a service in the system. It is
    uniquely identified by its signature (<a href="#api">system API</a>). The
    action is indivisible from semantical point of view (examples: get tarball,
    get project API, etc.).
  </dd>

  <dt>scenario</dt>
  <dd>
    It can be seen as an algorithm (a recipe) which consists of a sequence of
    <i>actions</i> which have to be evaluated in order to get outcome.
    A scenario has its input (e.g. tarballs, package name, etc.) and the outcome
    (e.g. list of dependencies for given package, etc.). Scenarios are
    implemented on the client side.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Client</h3>

<p>
Let's look at gofed-ng system like on an orchestra. There are musicians, who
know how to play one particular instrument (services), but there has to be
a conductor who would sync all the musicians and tell them what to do when in
order to make music. In the gofed-ng system, the client is the conductor and
implements algorithm (artwork) which has to be evaluated in order to get
appropriate results.

<p>
The algorithm is represented in scenarios. A scenario calls actions from <a
href="#api">gofed-ng system API</a>. The system implementation encapsulates all
the communication, object instantiations and all the other things which are
transparent for a user who wants to evaluate a scenario.

<p>
If you want to go deeper, let's have a look at <a href="#howto-scenario">how to
write a scenario</a>.

<h3>Registry</h3>

<p>
A registry is the main point of contact. If you do distributed computation,
you don't want to know where is every node situated. Moreover, location of
services can change from time to time, thus registry was introduced.

<p>
The registry is a node in the distributed system, which holds information needed
to locate a service. Basically it stores a tuple (service name, IP, port). If
a service wants to expose actions to a user, it registers itself in the
registry. If a client wants to use a service and it does not know it's location,
it asks the registry.

<p>
The registry is responsible for detecting dead nodes. It periodically pings
registered services. If the registry does not get a response from a service, it
automatically deletes the service from the registry to avoid offering dead
services to clients.

<h3>Services</h3>

<p>
A service provides some benefits to the system. They can provide computational
power, up to date analysis or precomputed data. There are two main types of
services in the gofed-ng system:
<ul>
  <li>a storage service</li>
  <li>a computational service</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage Services</h4>

<p>
Storage services provide data for the system. These data can be of various type
- a database holding analysis output, files, rpms, specfiles, etc.  Storage
services are end nodes in term that they cannot contact any other nodes
in the system (so the system cannot stuck in a dead lock).

<p>
A storage service which offers binary data units (e.g. tarballs, specfiles,
rpms, etc.) uses <i>file ids</i>.  Because of distributed computations, a client
can request a <i>file id</i>, which uniquely represents a file in the system.
This file id can be then used to reference the file unit in the whole system
- not only on client side, but on computational services as well. This optimizes
data transmissions in the system.

<h4>Computational Services</h4>

<p>
A computational service is a service, which offers computational power or up to
date analysis for a client. It is stateless. It can download files referenced by
<i>file ids</i>, do analysis on it, modify it, but the actual files and data
results are not stored on the service. At the end, every downloaded file is
deleted.

<p>
On the other hand, they can contact storage services to retrieve data from. They
cannot contact other computational services to prevent from dead locks.
