<h3>How a Service Works</h3>

<p>
Let's look at service inputs to understand how a service works. A service, which
runs as a standalone application uses <code>SectionEnvelope</code> to cover all
the necessary things, such as configuration file parsing or <code>System</code>
instantiation.

<p>
The <code>ServiceEnvelope</code> parses the configuration file and instantiates
<code>System</code> to be able to access all storages within the system, if
necessary. Thus a generic configuration file is automatically generated during
bootstrapping. You can define your own configuration key - value tuples, if you
need to by providing <code>service.conf.extended</code> file in the root of the
service directory.

<p>
The <code>ServiceEnvelope</code> collects all the information provided by
service implementation such as version, name and description, so you can inspect
service by simple hitting <code>python service.py --info</code>.

<p>
A service can use other services by calling its own <code>System</code>
instance or services can be instantiated locally without needs to use network,
do serialization and other overheads necessary to call a remote service. This
gives you a power to scale performance. To sum it up, you can selectively select
which services will be run as one process (you can group them together) and
which should be called remotely by passing the same configuration options like
on the client (you can do this on the client as well).

<h3>Computational services</h3>

<p>
Okay, now you are familiar with all the theory. A service implementation can
look like this:

<pre><code class="python">
import os
from common.service.computationalService import ComputationalService
from common.service.serviceEnvelope import ServiceEnvelope

class ExampleService(ComputationalService):
	''' An example service '''

	def signal_init(self):
		self.tmpfile = None

	def signal_destruct(self):
		if self.tmpfile is not None:
			os.remove(self.tmpfile)

	def exposed_action(self, param):
		'''
		An example of an exposed action to a client
		@param param: filename
		@return: file content
		'''

		self.tmpfile = os.path.join(self.get_tmp_dir(), os.path.basename(param))

		with self.get_lock():
			with open(self.tmpfile, "r") as f:
				content = f.read()

		return content

if __name__ == "__main__":
	ServiceEnvelope.serve(ExampleService)

</code></pre>

<p>
This service would possibly not be used, but we can demonstrate how to implement
a service. As you already know, there are two types of services in the system
- <code>ComputationalService</code> and <code>StorageService</code>. On the
first code example, we defined a computational service by inheriting
<code>ComputationalService</code> class.

<p>
Both service types use a signaling mechanism. There is a set of predefined
signals, which are sent to the service instance or it's class. Signals, which
are sent to service class - e.g. <code>signal_startup()</code> and
<code>signal_termination()</code> are not related to the interaction with
a client. These signals are sent when a service is starting up and terminating.
Signals, which are sent to the service class instance are related to client
interaction. The service class instance represents one particular connection
with the client (or with service when the service calls another service). A list
of all supported signals can be seen at the end of this page.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  Use defined signals when writing a scenario. Try to avoid using Python
  methods such as <code>__init__()</code>. Services are wrappers, which ensure
  that your service is communicating with the system correctly. Reserved names
  for methods:
  <ul>
    <li>methods starting with "on_" prefix, such as <code>on_connect()</code></li>
    <li>built in Python methods, such as <code>__init__()</code></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
In the example, we have defined <code>signal_init()</code>, which is called when
there will be instantiated an object of the service class type. We simply
defined a <code>tmpfile</code> attribute in order to carry information about
the temporary file created by the service. This file is removed when the service
object is going to be destructed. Using these methods, we are able to keep state
of service node clean - if you remember, a <code>ComputationalService</code>
does not have a persistent state.

<p>
We have defined <code>exposed_action()</code>, which is the action that can be
used by a client. Note the "<strong>exposed_</strong>" prefix. When you define
methods, that are prefixed with "exposed_", these (and only these!) methods will
be available to client calls. These methods are automatically analysed and added
to the <a href="#api">System API</a> when bootstrapping so clients can use it.
As you already know, this system API is distributed via autogenerated
<code>system.json</code> file, so clients (and services) know what actions are
provided by which services.

<p>
If you look at the <code>exposed_action()</code> implementation, it uses
inherited methods. Depending on the actual <code>Service</code> type
(<code>ComputationalService</code> or <code>StorageService</code>), there is
a set of predefined methods which are available. Basically these methods are
useful repeating routines. Look at the end of this page to see the listing.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  Each service instance runs in a separate thread, so use already implemented
  thread locking mechanism to avoid multi-thread related issues.
</div>

<p>
A service should take care of possible security issues. In the example, the
client can supply whatever string to access a file (e.g. "../../../.ssh/id_rsa")
and access whatever file an attacker wants - so <strong>be careful</strong>.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  Be careful with services, always watch out what you are doing to avoid
  security issues. Take care of locking as well. Use the context manager to
  correctly handle thread locking.
</div>

<p>
You can now save your first service to a file. Each service has its own
directory in <code>services/</code> directory in the root of git gofed-ng tree.
There are strict rules about service directory naming, service naming and
service files location. This rules help us to run automated analysis and do all
the dirty work for you, so obey them.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <ul>
     <li>
       Each service should be placed in a separate directory within
       <code>services/</code> directory.
     </li>

     <li>
       A service implementation should go to <code>service.py</code> file in the
       service directory.
     </li>

     <li>
       The service directory name has to conform to service class name without
       "Service" suffix and all lowercase (e.g. implementation of
       <code>ExampleStorageService</code> should go to
       <code>services/examplestorage/service.py</code>).
     </li>

     <li>
       Each service class should be derived from <code>StorageService</code> or
       <code>ComputationalService</code>, but not from both.
     </li>

     <li>
       There can be exposed only one action of its name in the whole system to
       be able to locate service by action name uniquely.
     </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
If you have saved your <code>ExampleService</code> to related file in
appropriate direcotry (<code>service/example/service.py</code>), you can run
<code>bootstrap.py</code> script to run service analysis and attach service to
the system. You can define <code>services/example/service.conf.extended</code>
as well if you want to extend basic service configuration file with your own key
- value tuples.

<h3>Storage services</h3>

<p>
Now you know how to write a <code>ComputationalService</code>. Writing
a <code>StorageService</code> is as easy as writing computational one, look:

<pre><code class="python">
import os
from common.service.storageService import StorageService
from common.service.serviceEnvelope import ServiceEnvelope

DEFAULT_MY_TMP_DIR = 'tmp'

class ExampleStorageService(StorageService):
	''' An example storage service '''

	@classmethod
	def signal_startup(cls, config):
		cls.tmpdir = config.get('my-tmp-dir', DEFAULT_MY_TMP_DIR)

	def get_my_tmp_dir(self):
		return self.__class__.tmpdir

	def exposed_download(self, file_id):
		'''
		An example of download method of a storage service
		@param file_id: id of a file in the system
		@return: file content
		'''
		filename = os.path.basename(file_id['identifier'])
		file_path = os.path.join(self.get_my_tmp_dir(), filename)

		with self.get_lock():
			with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
				content = f.read()

		return content

if __name__ == "__main__":
	ServiceEnvelope.serve(ExampleStorageService)

</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  Provide a <i>docstring</i> for exposed methods and service class. These
  <i>docstrings</i> is automatically parsed and is a part of auto-generated
  documentation and other parts of gofed-ng.
</div>

<p>
The only difference is type of super class in the inheritance
- <code>StorageService</code>. You can also see how to handle extended
configuration. The configuration file with all the necessary parts is auto
generated while bootstrapping, but you can extend it by your own values.
<pre><code>
$ cat services/example/service.conf.extended
my-tmp-dir = tmp
$

</pre></code>

<h4>How Files are Handled</h4>

<p>
To shrink transmission overload as much as possible, the system itself uses
only file ids instead of transferring whole blobs. A file id uniquely identifies
a file within the whole system and you can see it as a "pointer to a file". You
can make a file id by calling <code>get_file_id()</code> function on service
side. If you look at results, there is a control checksum generated, so if you
want to ensure, that a file is a file you have, you can just request a file id
and check checksums match.

<p>
The <code>System</code> has its built-in support for file ids. You can request
a file id by calling appropriate service action which delivers a file id. If you
want to download a file from the system referenced by the file id, simple call
<code>system.download(file_id, dst)</code> either on client or computational
service side. The <code>System</code> instance will correctly handle file
location traversal and the download process.

<p>
You can download files on computational services, do analysis or whatever you
need to do with the file to get appropriate results. But remember, that there is
no mechanism how to expose files on computational services. You can save file in
the file storage by calling <code>system.call.upload(blob)</code> implemented in
<code>FileStorageService</code>, if system runs this service and return file id
to a client. <code>FileStorageService</code> is considered to be a temporary
storage for files, so client has to decide based on scenario, what to do with
the file.

<p>
Hurray! Now you should be ready to develop your own services! You can have
a look at <a
href="https://github.com/gofed/gofed-ng/tree/master/services">already
implemented services on our github</a> and get the inspiration. Keeping fingers
crossed with your service implementation ☺.
